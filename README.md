Certainly! Below is the code for a `README.md` file that you can use for your REST client application:

```markdown
# REST Client Application

This is a simple REST client application built with Next.js that allows users to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to any API endpoint. The application also stores the history of requests made, using Prisma as the ORM for database interactions.

## Features

- Make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to any API endpoint.
- View the response data without page reloads.
- Store and display the history of requests made.
- Built with Next.js and Prisma.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database interactions.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database for storing request history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rest-client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Initialize Prisma:
     ```bash
     npx prisma init
     ```
   - Update the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define your data model (if not already done).
   - Run the migration:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev --name init
     ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/requests`: Retrieve the history of requests made.
- **POST** `/api/requests`: Create a new request entry in the history.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "http://example.com/api/resource",
      "body": "{\"key\":\"value\"}"
    }
    ```
- **PUT** `/api/requests/{id}`: Update an existing request entry.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "method": "PUT",
      "url": "http://example.com/api/resource/1",
      "body": "{\"key\":\"newValue\"}"
    }
    ```
- **DELETE** `/api/requests/{id}`: Delete a request entry by ID.

### Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Here are some examples:

- **GET Request**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/requests
  ```

- **POST Request**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "POST", "url": "http://example.com", "body": "{\"key\":\"value\"}"}'
  ```
